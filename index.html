                    <p>Dear Christine,</p>
                    <p>I want to start by saying how deeply sorry I am for the pain and confusion I've caused over the past year. Our friendship has always been incredibly important to me, and I realize now that my actions have jeopardized that.</p>
                    <p>When I ended our friendship last August, I thought I was doing the right thing. I was confused about my feelings and thought that creating distance was the solution. I couldn't have been more wrong. Reading your letters in September was a wake-up call, but by then, I felt too ashamed to reach out and make things right.</p>
                    <p>For months, I avoided you out of embarrassment, not knowing how to face you or explain my actions. But during that time, I thought about you and our friendship constantly. I missed our talks, our shared experiences, and the unique bond we had.</p>
                    <p>My attempts to talk to you during church camp were clumsy and confusing, I know. I was still trying to sort out my feelings, unsure if what I felt was romantic or just a deep appreciation for our friendship. Now, I understand that what I've been feeling all along is the value of our friendship - a connection that I mistakenly thought might be romantic but is actually something equally special and important.</p>
                    <p>Christine, you are an amazing person, and I feel incredibly lucky to have you in my life. I miss the closeness we once shared, the easy conversations, the laughter, and even the challenging discussions that helped us both grow.</p>
                    <p>I know my actions have been confusing and hurtful, and I understand if you need time or if you're hesitant to rebuild our friendship. But I want you to know that I'm here, ready to put in the work to regain your trust and rebuild our bond.</p>
                    <p>I hope we can move forward from this, learning from the past year and growing stronger. Our friendship means everything to me, and I'm committed to being the friend you deserve - honest, supportive, and always there for you.</p>
                    <p>Thank you for your patience and for being you. I'm hoping for the possibility of reconnecting and creating new, positive memories together, Alas, what i did and said in the past makes it harder and awkward.</p>
                    <p>I truly care deeply for you like a sister :) </p>
                    <p>Yours sincerely, Isaac</p>
